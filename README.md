# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 1. Overview
This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model based on features
such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## 2. Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

## 3. How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the training script:
python src/train.py


## 4. Model Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 5. Future Improvements
- Add feature scaling
- Try Random Forest or XGBoost
- Deploy model using Flask
